KGraphQL is a [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) implementation of [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) based
on [aPureBase/KGraphQL](https://github.com/aPureBase/KGraphQL). It provides a rich DSL to set up the GraphQL schema.

```kotlin
data class Article(val id: Int, val text: String)

suspend fun main() {
    val schema = KGraphQL.schema {
        query("article") {
            resolver { id: Int?, text: String ->
                Article(id ?: -1, text)
            }
        }
        type<Article> {
            property<String>("fullText") {
                resolver { article: Article ->
                    "${article.id}: ${article.text}"
                }
            }
        }
    }

    schema.execute("""
        {
            article(id: 5, text: "Hello World") {
                id
                fullText
            }
        }
    """.trimIndent()).let(::println)
}
```
